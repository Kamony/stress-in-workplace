In my professional work, I focus on mathematics, probability, and statistics and their didactics, informatics, working with information, ethics, and corporate education. Ph.D. I graduated from Palacký University in Olomouc in the field of pedagogy. I am a long-time member of the Union of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists.

**Research Area**

**Motivace:**

Stress is often a significant inhibitor in achieving higher goals, but it also has its own health risks. Using stress and managing an excessive level of stress at the same time is a challenge for every person throughout his life. I would like to learn more about the topic of stress and contribute to the solution of research questions with my experience, especially in the field of pedagogy and psychology.
