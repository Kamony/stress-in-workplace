**P﻿ersonal Drive**

Stress is a current threat not only to organizations but especially to individuals. It can limit our career and personal life. The consequences on health are devastating. In a Smart Society, it is crucial to implement advanced technology into its prevention and not use technology only for higher productivity, but also for improving life quality. Stress is my kryptonite and I hope we contribute to finding balance and mental well-being for Visegrad employees.
