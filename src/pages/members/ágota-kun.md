A﻿bout

Ágota Kun has been working as a lecturer and researcher in higher education for more than 26 years and as a consultant for 22 years.

Her professional focus is on the design and implementation of workplace stress management, mental health and wellbeing programs, and various workplace development programs. As a committed positive psychologist, her work seeks to promote a positive, solution-focused approach, and to highlight the positive and working factors in an organizational environment, rather than the gaps and problems. She is a work and organizational psychologist, trainer, and mediator, and specializes in solution-focused coaching. Her research interests include well-being and happiness at work, and how tailored positive psychological interventions can increase employee well-being, reduce stress and develop effective coping strategies.
