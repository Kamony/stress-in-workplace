I teach Coping with Demanding Situations in HRM and Organizational Behavior and, as a British and American Studies graduate, also English for Tourism and Business English. My science and research activities and publication outputs are focused primarily on the stress coping strategies, undesirable forms of behavior, and leadership styles.
