## **A﻿bout**

Having earned my doctorate in 2023, I focus on the emerging trends in stress management and age management. I research how stress affects individuals and organizations and I am committed to developing effective strategies to manage it. Another research area I am interested in is age management. I appreciate the uniqueness of various age demographics in today's business environment. I research the distinct skills, experiences, and challenges each age group brings to an organization. I strive to create strategies that capitalize on these differences, fostering a more productive, harmonious, and effective workplace.
