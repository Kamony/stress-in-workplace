      The developed questionnaire serves as a comprehensive tool designed to
      analyze and address workplace stress management practices in small and

      - Evaluation of coping strategies utilized by employees and organizations.

      - Exploration of the economic aspects related to workplace stress.



      Additionally, the questionnaire incorporates questions regarding the organizational profile, enabling a deeper understanding of the context in which these stress management practices operate.
